# Healthy_eating
The project presents diets based on your daily activity. From the technical side, the site is implemented in accordance with the standard of ES6 modules using modern elements on the site, for example: tabs, calculator, modal window. The peculiarity is that the "cards" on the site are generated dynamically using a request to the json-server. The data after sending is stored in the local database "db.json". Webpack is used to collect all models of both JS files and CSS. From the client's point of view, this can be useful if you care about your appearance or want to change and start a new life. We will be able to calculate your daily calorie intake based on anthropometric data and offer individual nutrition. And, of course, all this in combination with writing excellent BEM code and, as a result, convenient interface.
